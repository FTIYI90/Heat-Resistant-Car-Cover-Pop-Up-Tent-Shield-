## 🛠️ Design Alternatives Explored
1. **Automatic Windshield Sunshade**  
   - Compact, semi-smart solution.  
   - Limited coverage and higher mechanical complexity.  

2. **Full Exterior Reflective Cover**  
   - Simple and low-cost with full coverage.  
   - Manual setup, bulky, and less innovative.  

3. **Pop-Up Tent Shield** *(Chosen Solution)*  
   - Roof-mounted, deployable tent-like umbrella system.  
   - Innovative, modern, quick to deploy, and highly effective in thermal protection.
